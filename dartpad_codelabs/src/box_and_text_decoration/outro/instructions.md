# Congrats!

Yay! Congrats on making it through the workshop :) You've gone on a long journey
to decorate boxes and style text. You can display images and make some pretty
snazzy gradient backgrounds.

Furthermore, you've seen that Flutter provides many shortcuts for common tasks:
widgets, like `Container`, that reduce nesting or constructors, like
`Border.all`, that reduce the amount of code you have to write.

If you'd like, please spend some time combining all of the different techniques
discussed in the previous steps using the Dartpad to the right. Play around
with different box and text styles to create something unique, or take some
inspiration from a recent design you've needed to implement in another project
and try to make it happen in Flutter!
